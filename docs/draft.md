### Questions to Answer (R&D)

### Vision Statement
* **For** special services tachtical units (fire bragade, police, millitary)
* **For** anyone who is doing sport activity
* **Who** are concerned with improving performance
* **The** Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition
* **Is** a R&D project
* **That** will allow to track state {staying | walking | running} and calculate metrics (jump heigh) of a person with wearable device
* **Unlike** (think about competitorâ€™s disadvantage)
* **Our product** (think about our advantages of your app)
* **Motivation**

### Detailed proposal for your system
* Tracking in real/near-time the state {staing | walking | running/jumping/falling} of a person with wearable sensor
* Measuring jump height (beach VL + indoor VL players)
* Measuring social distancing using wearables

#### Problems to solve
* position handling of wearable devices [1]
* the need of large expensive labeled datasets [1]
* the requirement to recognize activities in almost real-time [1]

### Risks to the project
* not having enough experience engineers to deal with tech-stack (HW + SW)
* not having comprehensive research meterials 
* not having appropriate technology
* not possible to come up with appropriate practical solutions
* too much complexity of the task with limited resources
**set priority to requirement**
* can be hard to run integration / system testing
**solved for the sport activity | access to beach VL, indoor VL clubs**
